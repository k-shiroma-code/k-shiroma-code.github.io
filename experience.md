    <p>During my time as a Peer Tutor at Norco College, I supported over 100 students in Calculus, Statistics, and C++. I helped them develop problem-solving skills and a deeper understanding of complex topics. Maintaining accurate documentation and timesheets was an integral part of my role. This experience strengthened my communication and mentoring abilities.</p>

    <p>As a Data Science Intern for the CIC Summer Research Program, I cleaned and structured 5,903 European football match records. I engineered Elo-based ratings, improving model performance by 10%. I built Logistic Regression and XGBoost models achieving 61% accuracy and enhanced minority-class recall by 20% using SMOTE and undersampling. This experience reinforced my skills in data cleaning, feature engineering, and predictive modeling.</p>
