    <p>As a Peer Tutor at Norco College, I supported over 100 students in Calculus, Statistics, and C++.

## CIC Summer Research Program – Data Science Intern
*May – July 2024*

<div style="display: flex; align-items: flex-start; gap: 30px; margin: 20px 0;">
  <div style="flex: 1; min-width: 300px;">
    <p>During the CIC Summer Research Program, I worked as a Data Science Intern analyzing 5,903 European football match records. I engineered ELO-based ratings and applied machine learning models including Logistic Regression and XGBoost, improving predictive performance by 10%. I also addressed class imbalance issues, boosting minority-class recall by 20% using SMOTE and undersampling. This project strengthened my data analysis, feature engineering, and model evaluation skills.</p>
