    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hey there! I'm <strong>Kyle Shiroma</strong>, and I'm absolutely fascinated by the stories data can tell. Currently making my way from <strong>Norco College (A.S. Mathematics)</strong> 
      to <strong>UC San Diego (B.S. Data Science)</strong>, and loving every step of this journey into turning numbers into real solutions.
    </p>

      I get genuinely excited about finding patterns where others see chaos—whether that's digging into retail data to help businesses grow or creating AI health tools 
      that actually help people (super proud to be a <strong>2025 AI4Purpose NYC Winner!</strong>). My go-to tools are <strong>Python, R, SQL, Tableau, TensorFlow, and Scikit-learn</strong>, 
      and I love building everything from machine learning models to dashboards that make complex data feel simple.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lately, I've been geeking out over <strong>Apache Airflow</strong> and data engineering—there's something magical about setting up <strong>AWS, Kubernetes, and Docker</strong> 
      workflows that just... work perfectly, day after day. It's like building invisible robots that handle all the heavy lifting while you sleep!
    </p>
    <p>
      When I'm not buried in code, I'm probably analyzing <strong>soccer stats</strong> (because why not turn your hobbies into data projects?), brainstorming <strong>healthcare tech</strong> ideas, 
      or figuring out what makes customers tick. You'll also find me kicking a ball around, hiking somewhere beautiful, or savoring that perfect diet coke moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Love connecting with fellow data enthusiasts and collaborating on projects that actually matter—let's build something cool together!</strong>
