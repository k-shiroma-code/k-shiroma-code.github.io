    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I’m <strong>Kyle Shiroma</strong>, a data science student transferring from <strong>Norco College (A.S. in Mathematics, Aug 2022 – Jun 2025)</strong> 
      to <strong>UC San Diego (B.S. in Data Science, Sept 2025 – Jun 2027)</strong>. 
      My work blends <strong>technical skill</strong> and <strong>real-world problem solving</strong>, from analyzing half a million retail transactions 
      to building AI-powered health tools as a <strong>2025 AI4Purpose NYC Winner</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      My technical toolkit includes <strong>Python, R, SQL, Tableau, TensorFlow, and Scikit-learn</strong>, with experience in <strong>machine learning</strong>, 
      <strong>data visualization</strong>, and <strong>scalable pipeline development</strong>. 
      I’m passionate about projects in <strong>soccer analytics, healthcare, and customer behavior</strong> — and I love finding patterns 
      that lead to <strong>actionable insights</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      I recently completed the <strong>Udemy course: "Master Apache Airflow"</strong>, a hands-on program covering 
      <strong>Airflow with AWS, Kubernetes, Docker</strong>, and more. The course included practical videos</strong>, 
      <strong>103 lectures</strong>, and taught advanced concepts like <strong>scaling DAGs, monitoring with Elasticsearch and Grafana</strong>, 
      and <strong>securing Airflow with RBAC and authentication</strong>. This experience strengthened my skills in 
      <strong>production-grade data pipelines</strong> and <strong>workflow orchestration</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of coding, you’ll find me outdoors, on the soccer field, or experimenting with new ways to make data tell a story.
