    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm <b>Kyle Shiroma</b>, a <b>Data Science student at UC San Diego</b> who transforms data into solutions that matter. From <b>retail analytics</b> to <b>AI-driven health tools</b> (<b>2025 AI4Purpose NYC Winner</b>), I focus on projects with real-world impact.
    </p>
    <p>
      I build end-to-end data solutions using <b>Python</b>, <b>SQL</b>, <b>R</b>, and <b>Tableau</b> for <b>machine learning models</b> and <b>data pipelines</b>. Currently scaling up with <b>Apache Airflow</b>, <b>AWS</b>, <b>Docker</b>, and <b>Kubernetes</b> for production-grade data engineering.
    </p>
    <p>
      Beyond the terminal, I'm fueling my competitive side through sports and staying creative with manga.
