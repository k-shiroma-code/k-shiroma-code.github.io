<h2>About Me</h2>
<p>
  I'm Kyle Shiroma, a data science student transferring from Norco College (A.S. Mathematics) 
  to UC San Diego (B.S. Data Science). I work on projects that solve actual problems, from retail analytics to AI health tools 
  (2025 AI4Purpose NYC Winner).
</p>
<p>
  My toolkit includes Python, R, SQL, Tableau, TensorFlow, and Scikit-learn for building machine learning models, 
  data pipelines, and visualizations. I’m currently focused on Apache Airflow, AWS, Kubernetes, and Docker 
  for scalable data engineering workflows.
</p>
<p>
  As a former soccer player, I’m especially interested in soccer analytics, as well as healthcare applications 
  and customer behavior analysis. Outside of coding, I enjoy soccer, hiking, and watching anime.
</p>
<p>
  I’m open to collaborating on data science projects with real-world impact.
