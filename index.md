    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm <strong>Kyle Shiroma</strong>, a data science student transferring from <strong>Norco College (A.S. Mathematics)</strong> 
      to <strong>UC San Diego (B.S. Data Science)</strong>. I work on projects that solve actual problems, from retail analytics to AI health tools 
      (<strong>2025 AI4Purpose NYC Winner</strong>).
    </p>
    <p>
      My toolkit includes <strong>Python, R, SQL, Tableau, TensorFlow, and Scikit-learn</strong> for building machine learning models, 
      data pipelines, and visualizations. Currently focused on <strong>Apache Airflow, AWS, Kubernetes, and Docker</strong> 
      for scalable data engineering workflows.
    </p>
    <p>
      I'm interested in <strong>soccer analytics, healthcare applications,</strong> and <strong>customer behavior analysis</strong>. 
      Outside of coding, I play soccer, spend time outdoors, and drink way too much diet coke.
    </p>
    <p>
      Open to collaborating on data science projects with real-world impact.
