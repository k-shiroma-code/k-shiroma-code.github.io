  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I'm <strong>Kyle Shiroma</strong>, a data science student transferring from <strong>Norco College (A.S. Mathematics)</strong> 
    to <strong>UC San Diego (B.S. Data Science)</strong>. I work on projects that solve actual problems, from retail analytics to AI health tools 
    (<strong>2025 AI4Purpose NYC Winner</strong>).
  </p>
  <p>
    My toolkit includes <strong>Python, R, SQL, Tableau, TensorFlow, and Scikit-learn</strong> for building machine learning models, 
    data pipelines, and visualizations. Currently focused on <strong>Apache Airflow, AWS, Kubernetes, and Docker</strong> 
    for scalable data engineering workflows.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm interested in <strong>soccer analytics, healthcare applications,</strong> and <strong>customer behavior analysis</strong>. 
    Outside of coding, I play soccer, spend time outdoors, and drink way too much diet coke.
  </p>
  <p>
    Open to collaborating on data science projects with real-world impact.
