  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I’m completing my Associate of Science in Mathematics at Norco College (August 2022 – June 2025) and will be transferring to UC San Diego to pursue a B.S. in Data Science (September 2025 – June 2027). 
    I’m passionate about transforming data into actionable insights and have explored projects in soccer analytics, healthcare, and cybersecurity. 
    Outside of academics, I enjoy the outdoors and tackling real-world challenges through data-driven solutions.
