    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I’m Kyle Shiroma, a data science student transferring from Norco College (A.S. in Mathematics, Aug 2022 – Jun 2025) 
      to UC San Diego (B.S. in Data Science, Sept 2025 – Jun 2027). 
      My work blends technical skill and real-world problem solving, from analyzing half a million retail transactions 
      to building AI-powered health tools as a <strong>2025 AI4Purpose NYC Winner</strong>.
    </p>
    <p>
      My technical toolkit includes Python, R, SQL, Tableau, TensorFlow, and Scikit-learn, with experience in machine learning, 
      data visualization, and scalable pipeline development. 
      I’m passionate about projects in soccer analytics, healthcare, and customer behavior — and I love finding patterns 
      that lead to actionable insights.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of coding, you’ll find me outdoors, on the soccer field, or experimenting with new ways to make data tell a story.
